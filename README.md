## Problem Statement

You are part of a team at an airline company aiming to enter the United States domestic market. The company's strategy involves initiating 5 round trip routes between medium and large US airports. Each round trip route, for example, JFK to ORD and ORD to JFK, requires the acquisition of a new airplane, with an upfront cost of $90 million per aircraft. Punctuality is a crucial aspect of the company's brand image, as reflected in its motto, "On time, for you."

## Objectives

1. **Identify Top 10 Busiest Routes:**
   - Analyze 1Q2019 data to determine the 10 busiest round trip routes based on the number of completed flights. Exclude canceled flights from the calculation.

2. **Analyze 10 Most Profitable Routes:**
   - Determine the 10 most profitable round trip routes for the quarter, excluding upfront airplane costs. Provide details on total revenue, total cost, summary values of key components, and the total number of round trip flights for the top 10 routes. Cancelled flights should be excluded from these calculations.

3. **Recommend Investment Routes:**
   - Recommend 5 round trip routes for investment based on factors of your choice.

4. **Calculate Breakeven Flights:**
   - Determine the number of round trip flights needed to break even on the upfront airplane cost for each of the 5 recommended routes. Present key summary components for these routes.

5. **Propose Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Recommend KPIs for tracking the success of the recommended round trip routes in the future.
